title: UDAL Queries
---

This section describes how to query the EMO-BON knowledge graph using UDAL (Universal Data Access Layer).

## Overview

UDAL provides a unified interface for querying EMO-BON data across different sources and formats.

## SPARQL Endpoint

The EMO-BON triple store exposes a SPARQL endpoint for querying the knowledge graph:

- **Endpoint URL**: sparql.emobon.embrc.eu or api.emobon.embrc.eu
- **Query Language**: SPARQL 1.1

## Named Queries

UDAL provides a set of named queries for common data access patterns:

:::{note}
Named queries are under development and will be documented here.

## Using UDAL with VREs

Virtual Research Environments (VREs) can consume EMO-BON data through:
- UDAL named queries
- Semantic query + UDAL integration

## Example Queries

Example SPARQL queries will be provided here to demonstrate:
- Retrieving observatory information
- Querying sample data
- Finding sequences by criteria
- Accessing analysis results
