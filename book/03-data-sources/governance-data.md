## Governance Data

Governance data is structured information that outlines how decisions are made within a community, project, or organization â€” including who is responsible, what processes are followed, and how participation is organized. By making these elements explicit and accessible, governance data supports transparency, accountability, and collaboration, helping to create systems that are fair, inclusive, and adaptable.

For the EMO-BON project, governance data is openly available on GitHub:

This repository serves as the central source for structured governance-related information, and includes:

- [**logsheets.csv**](https://github.com/emo-bon/governance-crate/blob/main/logsheets.csv)  
  Contains the URLs of the Google Sheets that are the logsheets, the date range to be harvested, the responsible agent, and whether the observatory is a core EMO-BON site.

- [**observatories.csv**](https://github.com/emo-bon/governance-crate/blob/main/observatories.csv)
