## Sampling Data

### Logsheets

Sampling logsheets are structured records that document key metadata related to emo-bon observatories, the sampling activities conducted in their vicinity, and the samples collected during those events.  

These logsheets are openly accessible and maintained as Google spreadsheets. A centralized master list provides direct access to the logsheets for each station:

### Observatory crate 
Additionally, raw versions of the logsheets are harvested into GitHub and stored as CSV files within each observatoryâ€™s dedicated data crate. These are used as input during the QC processes.  

For example, the logsheets for the *HCMR observatory* are available [here](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-hcmr-1-crate/tree/main/logsheets/raw ).
