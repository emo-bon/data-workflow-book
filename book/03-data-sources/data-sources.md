## Primary Data Sources

### Logsheets Data

Sampling logsheets are structured records that document key metadata related to emo-bon observatories, the sampling activities conducted in their vicinity, and the samples collected during those events.  

These logsheets are openly accessible and maintained as Google spreadsheets. A centralized master list provides direct access to the logsheets for each station:

Additionally, raw versions of the logsheets are harvested into GitHub and stored as CSV files within each observatoryâ€™s dedicated data crate. For example, the logsheets for the *HCMR observatory* are available [here](https://github.com/emo-bon/observatory-hcmr-1-crate/tree/main/logsheets/raw ).


### Analysis Results Data

Samples are further analysed in batches.  

Results are available in:
