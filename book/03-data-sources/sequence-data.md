title: Sequence Data

### Genoscope

Sequence data are generated by [Genoscope](https://www.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/Genoscope.aspx) and are hosted internally (closed access) on their infrastructure. These data consists of DNA sequence files, each identified by a unique genoscope ID which is matched to the EMO BON material sample ID. 


### ENA

The generated sequence data are regularly submitted to the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home). IN ENA we have the EMO BON umbrella project [PRJEB51688] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51688), under which are the project accession numbers for each EMO BON observatory. Once the sequences are uploaded from Genoscope to ENA, they are associated with a unique ENA run accession number and related metadata (for example: [ERR13955095](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR13955095) or [ERR13954264](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR13954264)). 

<!--
> **Types of ENA accession numbers:**  
> You can submit and describe various types of data to ENA, including projects, studies, (bio)samples, experiments, runs, and analyses. Each data type is assigned a unique accession number upon submission, for example:  
> 
> | **Accession Type** | **Accession Format**        | **Example**   |
> |-----------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
> | **Project**    | PRJ(E\|D\|N)[A-Z][0-9]+        | PRJEB12345    |
> | **Study**     | (E\|D\|S)RP[0-9]{6,}           | ERP123456     |
> | **BioSample**  | SAM(E\|D\|N)[A-Z]?[0-9]+       | SAMEA123456   |
> |  **Sample**    | (E\|D\|S)RS[0-9]{6,}           | ERS123456     |
> | **Experiment** | (E\|D\|S)RX[0-9]{6,}           | ERX123456     |
> | **Run**        | (E\|D\|S)RR[0-9]{6,}           | ERR123456     |
> | **Analysis**    | (E\|D\|S)RZ[0-9]{6,}           | ERZ123456     |

In context of EMO-BON, following data types / accession numbers are relevant: 
- (Bio)Sample accession number (e.g. [SAMEA114561122](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SAMEA114561122)) 
- experiment accession number, for metagenomics sequences (e.g. [ERX13356190](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERX13356190)) 
- run accession number, for metagenomics sequences (e.g. [ERR13955095](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR13955095)) 
- project accession number (e.g. [PRJEB51652](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51652)) 
- umbrella assession number (i.e. all of EMO BON) (always [PRJEB51688](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51688))   


### Sequence Crate

Sequence metadata is available in the [sequencing-crate repository](https://github.com/emo-bon/sequencing-crate), along with links to both Genoscope (via genoscope IDs) and ENA (via ENA accession numbers).  
The repository is structured in **shipment batches** (for example: [batch‑001](https://github.com/emo-bon/sequencing-crate/tree/main/shipment/batch-001)), where each batch folder contains all the files pertaining to that group’s analyses – metadata tables, accession mappings, and any supplementary documentation for that batch.
