This section introduces the purpose and scope of the EMO-BON Data Workflow Handbook.

## Purpose

The EMO-BON Data Workflow Handbook is intended to provide clear and comprehensive documentation of the data management processes used within the EMO-BON project. It explains the technical infrastructure and tools that support the workflow, outlines best practices and conventions to follow, and helps users understand the various data products produced and how to access them.

## Scope

The handbook covers the full lifecycle of data within the EMO-BON systemâ€”from initial collection in the field to final publication and sharing. It describes the different sources from which data is gathered, details the types of outputs generated (such as RO-Crates and associated metadata), and provides an overview of the technical infrastructure behind the workflow. It also includes the standards and conventions used for naming, formatting, and organizing data throughout the system.

## Audience

This documentation is aimed at a wide range of users involved in or interested in the EMO-BON project. It is especially useful for project partners and collaborators, developers working on the EMO-BON infrastructure, and data managers or curators responsible for maintaining data quality and consistency. Additionally, it serves as a helpful reference for anyone seeking to better understand how data flows through the EMO-BON system
